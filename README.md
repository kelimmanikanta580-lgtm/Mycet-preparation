ABSTRACT

My CET Preparation is an innovative, comprehensive digital platform created to support students preparing for the Common Entrance Test (CET), an important exam for fields like Engineering, Pharmacy, and Agriculture. The system offers topic-wise study materials that closely follow the CET syllabus, giving users organized resources such as notes, reference materials, and past question papers. The platform also includes timed mock tests that mimic the real exam, along with instant performance analytics and feedback to help users improve their skills. Features like secure login, personalized dashboards, and accessibility focus on providing a convenient, cost-effective, and interactive way for students to excel in the CET exams.[1]
